# LogViewer

A simple, python-implemented, GUI based tool for parsing logs.

I've implemented the original tool over 10 years ago using python 2. I've recently found it in some old repo of mine and decided to make it public. What you find in 2.7/ is the original version fixed to make it work with 2.7 and latest wxPython. In future I hope to add 3.X (X depending on when that's going to happen).
